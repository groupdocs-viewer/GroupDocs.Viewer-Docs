Once a document is loaded, you can retrieve its properties. For example, you can retrieve the format family and the page count to select a rendering strategy. Also, you can display information about the document during rendering or with the rendered document.

This section describes how to retrieve the document properties. Also, it shows how to get a list of supported file formats.

* A file type is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. For example, Microsoft Word (.docx) and Adobe PDF (.pdf) are two different file types.
* A format family is a group of several file types for which an application provides additional information. For example, archive files (.7z, .rar, .zip, etc.) or Outlook files (.ost, .pst) are format families.
