## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

### Behavior changes

*   In this version we've improved viewing of Presonal Storage [OST](https://wiki.fileformat.com/email/ost/)/[PST](https://wiki.fileformat.com/email/pst/) files and as a result, the behavior changed.  
    Now when viewing personal storage OST /PST files the **Inbox** folder is selected and displayed by default as it shown on the screenshot below.
