This article contains information about migration from the legacy API to GroupDocs.Viewer 19.8 or higher.

## Why To Migrate

Here are the key reasons to use the new updated API provided by **GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET** since version **19.8**:
* **Viewer** class introduced as a **single entry point** to manage the document rendering process to any supported file format (instead of **ViewerHtmlHander** / **ViewerImageHander** classes from previous versions).
* The overall **rendering speed improved** dramatically by saving rendered page as soon as it was rendered, not when all pages list were rendered.
* Product architecture was redesigned from scratch in order to **decreased memory usage** (from 10% to 400% approx. depending on document type).
* Document **rendering options simplified** so itâ€™s easy to instantiate proper options class and control over document rendering and saving processes.

## How To Migrate

Here is a brief comparison of how to display document into HTML form using old and new API.  

**Old coding style**

```csharp
//Get Configurations
ViewerConfig config = Utilities.GetConfigurations();

// Create html handler
ViewerHtmlHandler htmlHandler = new ViewerHtmlHandler(config);

// Guid implies that unique document name 
string guid = "sample.docx";

//Instantiate the HtmlOptions object
HtmlOptions options = new HtmlOptions();

//to get html representations of pages with embedded resources
options.IsResourcesEmbedded = true;

// Set password if document is password protected. 
if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(DocumentPassword))
   options.Password = DocumentPassword;
            
//Get document pages in html form
List<PageHtml> pages = htmlHandler.GetPages(guid, options);

foreach (PageHtml page in pages)
{
    //Save each page at disk
    Utilities.SaveAsHtml(page.PageNumber + "_" + DocumentName, page.HtmlContent);
}
```

**New coding style**

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("sample.docx"))
{
   HtmlViewOptions options = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources();
   viewer.View(options);
}
```
