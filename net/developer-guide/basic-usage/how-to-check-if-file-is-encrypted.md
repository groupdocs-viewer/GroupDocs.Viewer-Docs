The encryption is used to protect the file, so the only people with an encryption key (such as a password) can open and view a file.
In case you want to check if a file is encrypted, you can use _GetFileInfo()_ method that returns file type and flag that indicates if the file is encrypted as it is shown in the next example ([this example](https://github.com/groupdocs-viewer/GroupDocs.Viewer-for-.NET/blob/master/Examples/GroupDocs.Viewer.Examples.CSharp/BasicUsage/CheckFileIsEncrypted.cs) can be found in our examples at GitHub.)

```csharp
using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("encrypted.pdf"))
{
    FileInfo fileInfo = viewer.GetFileInfo();

    Console.WriteLine("File type is: " + fileInfo.FileType);
    Console.WriteLine("File encrypted: " + fileInfo.Encrypted);
}
```

After running the code above you will see an output like this:

```bash
File type is: Portable Document Format File (.pdf)
File encrypted: True
```
