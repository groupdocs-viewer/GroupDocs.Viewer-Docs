In GroupDocs.Viewer, rendering is the process of converting a document into one or more files suitable to display. The resulting files can be in one of the following formats:

* HTML
* PDF
* Images (JPG or PNG)

If the source document contains several pages, the result of rendering to PDF is one paginated file.
Rendering a multi-page document to HTML or images results in multiple files, one for each page.

For example, if you have a .docx file with three pages, converting that file to HTML/images results in three HTML or image files that represent the pages in the document. Converting this file to PDF results in one file with three pages
