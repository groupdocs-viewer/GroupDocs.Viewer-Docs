We use the term "rendering" in GroupDocs.Viewer to describe the process of converting a document into a file format, paginated, or that has the concept of pages. For example, when you have a DOCX file with three pages then after rendering this file to HTML you'll get three HTML files on the output that represent each of the pages in the document.
