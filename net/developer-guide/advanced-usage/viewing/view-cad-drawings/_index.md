**CAD** (Computer-Aided Design) files may contain 2D or 3D designs. They are generated by CAD software programs, which can be used to create models or architectural plans. 2D CAD files are often referred to as drawings, while 3D files are often called models, parts, or assemblies. The AutoCAD is arguably the most prevalent CAD software on the market. It’s used by professionals and hobbyists alike. If you work with CAD, you’re likely to already be familiar with some of AutoCAD’s most common file formats, such as **DWG** and **DXF**.
