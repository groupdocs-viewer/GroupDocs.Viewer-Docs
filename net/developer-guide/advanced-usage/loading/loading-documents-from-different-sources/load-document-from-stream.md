There might be the case when your document is not physically located on the disk. Instead, you have the document in the form of a stream. In this case, to avoid the overhead of saving stream as a file on disk, GroupDocs.Viewer enables you to render the file streams directly.

The following are the steps to be followed:

* Specify the method to obtain document stream;
* Pass method's name to [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/viewer/groupdocs.viewer/viewer) class constructor.

Following code snippet serves this purpose.

```csharp
static void LoadDocumentFromStream()
{
    Stream stream = File.OpenRead("sample.docx");

    using (Viewer viewer = new Viewer(stream))
    {
        HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.ForEmbeddedResources();
        viewer.View(viewOptions);
    }
}
```
