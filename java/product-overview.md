GroupDocs.Viewer for Java is a high-performance and cross-platform library that allows you to build desktop and web [file viewer applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_viewer).

With its powerful and straightforward API, you can execute the following actions:

* View documents in the [most popular file formats](/viewer/java/supported-document-formats/) (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, DWG, PSD, HTML, ZIP, and more) by rendering them as HTML, PDF, PNG, and JPEG files. You no longer need third-party software to view files within your Java application.
* Load documents from [different sources](/viewer/java/loading-documents-from-different-sources/) (a file, a stream, a URL, an FTP server, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and so on).
* Open [password-protected documents](/viewer/java/load-password-protected-document/).
* Render the entire document or specific pages.
* Embed all external resources in the output HTML files, generate [responsive](/viewer/java/render-with-responsive-layout/) and [minified](/viewer/java/minify-html/) HTML pages.
* [Protect](/viewer/java/protect-pdf-documents/) the output PDF files and [reorder their pages](/viewer/java/reorder-pages/).
* [Rotate pages](/viewer/java/flip-or-rotate-pages/) in the output files.
* Specify whether to render notes and comments contained in the source document.
* Extract text from PDF files and images.
* [Extract archive contents](/viewer/java/how-to-extract-and-save-attachments/) and [save files](/viewer/java/how-to-extract-and-save-attachments/) attached to PDF documents, email messages, and Outlook data files.
* [Obtain basic information](/viewer/java/how-to-get-file-type-and-pages-count/) about the source document (the file type, number of pages, and page information).
* [Replace missing document fonts](/viewer/java/replace-missing-font/) or [specify a folder](/viewer/java/set-custom-fonts/) where GroupDocs.Viewer should look for these fonts.
* [Add text watermarks](/viewer/java/add-text-watermark/) to the output HTML, PDF, and image files.
* [Implement caching](/viewer/java/caching-results/) to increase document loading speed and optimize application performance.

You can use GroupDocs.Viewer across multiple platforms and operation systems:

* Windows, Linux, and macOS
* Java 5 and higher
