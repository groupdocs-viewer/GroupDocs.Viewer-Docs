GroupDocs.Viewer renders items from the rootÂ of the archive by default.

When rendering of a specified folder is required, it can be achieved as shown in the examples below.

```java
    try (Viewer viewer = new Viewer("sample.zip")) {
        HtmlViewOptions viewOptions = HtmlViewOptions.forEmbeddedResources();
        viewOptions.getArchiveOptions().setFolder("ThirdFolderWithItems");
        viewer.view(viewOptions);
    }
```
