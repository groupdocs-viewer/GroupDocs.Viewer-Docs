To render documents, you must load them first. This section describes ways to load documents implemented in GroupDocs.Viewer.

You can also define document loading options, such as a document type or a password for a password-protected document. To do this, use the constructor parameters and properties of the [LoadOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/LoadOptions) class.
