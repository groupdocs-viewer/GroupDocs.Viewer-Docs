GroupDocs.Viewer for Java  API depends on javax.xml.bind for working with PDF files, that is; in case of using Java 9 and above and if the program is required to work with PDF file types, it is required to add reference of `javax.xml.bind` in the projectâ€™s class path, because the library was removed from standard Java library.

## Symptoms

You may get exception like `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/DatatypeConverter`.

## Solution

The solution is actually very simple as detailed below.

* Download `jaxb-api-2.3.0.jar` library as JAR file from [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.xml.bind).
* Put the file into your project directory.
* Reference the `jaxb-api-2.3.0.jar` in the class path of the project.

Alternatively, you can add the dependency in the pom.xml and let the project resolve the dependency via maven.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```
